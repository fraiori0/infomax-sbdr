- standard flo model, using the custom flo without exponential
- jaccard similarity with bias of 1e-2
- uses global average pooling after convolutional layers

- differently from trial number 1, here we apply some noise on the outputs (so SBDR comparison is done on noised version, not only on versions from different inputs)
