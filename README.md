TODO: test using cosine distance and normalization with 1e0 bias on the norm

## Plots

Use error bars in all plots

Concentration:
    x: different concentration
    multiple traces: different average number of non-zero units
    use sharp activations 

Sharpness: AND vs Jaccard (with some fixed amount) 
    x: different sharpness
    multiple traces: different average number of non-zero units
    use high concentration

Ideal case:
    x: average number of non-zero units
    only two traces, ideal and not
    use same color  but different patterns for ideal vs non-ideal

Resistance to noise
    x: amount of noise
    multiple traces: different average of non-zero units
    use high concentration
    use sharp activation
